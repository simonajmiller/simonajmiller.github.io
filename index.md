I am a fourth year PhD Candidate in Physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), studying the spins of merging binary black hole systems with gravitational-wave data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).
Broadly, I'm interested in how we measure binary black hole properties from gravitational-wave signals—from both a physical and statistical standpoint—and in building a more inclusive, supportive culture in physics academia that serves the public good. You can learn more about my research interests [here](/research/), and read my publications [here](/publications/).

I am a member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/), and currently work in the group of [Dr. Katerina Chatziioannou](https://kchatziioannou.github.io/index.html). I graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 2020 with a Bachelor's in Physics, minor in Mathematics, and [thesis](https://scholarworks.smith.edu/theses/2305/) with highest honors. Before coming to Caltech in 2021, I then spent a year researching gravitational-waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars in Germany at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics under a Fulbright Research Scholarship.

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring undergraduate scientists.
My mentoring philosophy centers on providing consistent, individually-tailored intra- and extra-curricular guidance and creating strong, community-based support structures. My skills and outlook from extensive experience with one-on-one mentorship, advocacy for increased representation, and leadership in community-building projects. You can read more about my mentoring philosophy [here](/mentoring/2025/04/10/example.html) and relevant experience [here](/teaching-mentoring-outreach/).

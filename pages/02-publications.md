### **Overview** 

**I have co-authored 9 short author-list papers total.** Of these I am the first author on four (highlighted below in <span style="background-color:#b6dde4">blue</span>) and second-author on three.
Three more papers are in preparation; these are also listed below and have a <span style="color:#8c8f8f">lighter text color</span>.


**I have also significantly contributed to four LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration papers.** I was on the paper writing team and served as a key analyst for one LVK paper(about the population properties of compact binary mergers as of our fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog release), served as a lead analyst for another (about constraining Hawking's Area Law with the loudest gravitational-wave detection to date), and contributed analysis to two more. These contributions and others can be verified [here](https://laac.docs.ligo.org/recognition/2025/09/11/simona-miller).

In the list below, each section is organized chronologically with the most recent publication at the top.
Publications marked with a star (★) are co-authored by an undergraduate mentee; for two of these works, I mentored the student to first-authorship.

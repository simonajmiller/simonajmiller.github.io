I am interested in how and why we can measure subtle effects in gravitational-wave signals, from both a physical and statistical standpont. 
I want to answer questions like: How do precessing spins imprint on merger/ringdown-dominated gravitational waves? What non-astrophysical phenomena can mimic spins and how do we distinguish between real and spurious measurements? On a population-level, how can we improve the robustness of spin measurements through better statistical model-checking procedures?

I will fill in more about my research here

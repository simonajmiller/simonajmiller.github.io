Throughout our universe, pairs of **black holes** with masses between around 5-100 times that of our sun orbit each other for millions of years. 
They lose energy via the emission of **gravitational waves**: ripples in the fabric of space-time itself that propagate outwards at the speed of light. 
This loss of energy causes the black holes to spiral inwards towards one-another, until they merge in the cosmos' most extreme collisions: in a fraction of a second, one binary black hole merger releases over ten times more energy than all of the starlight in the observable universe.

The morphology of the gravitational waves emitted by these magnificent binary black hole (**BBH**) mergers depend on the component masses, spins, orientation, etc. of the system and are predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity.
Over the last decade, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (**LIGO**), along with the Virgo and KAGRA observatories, have detected *hundreds* of gravitational-wave signals from BBHs. 
This global network of detectors is made up of giant ground-based interferometers. 
They use laser light to measure gravitational-wave-induced changes in length one trillion times smaller than a proton, making them the most sensitivie instruments ever created. 

**I am interested in how, when, and why we can measure subtle effects in gravitational-wave signals, from both an astrophysical and statistical standpont.**
Much of my work focuses on the **spin** of black holes, also known as their intrinsic angular momenta.
Spin is a crucial probe of the astrophysical origin of BBHs, and yet is notoriously difficult to constrain via gravitational waves, *especially* in signals from the **high-mass** BBHs which fall at the edge of LIGO's sensitivity.
I want to answer questions like: 

\
★ *How do precessing spins imprint on the gravitational waves we observe from high-mass binary black holes, which are dominated by the non-linear merger regime?* 

\
★ *What can post-merger data tell us about pre-merger dynamics?* 

\
★ *What non-astrophysical phenomena can mimic spins and how do we distinguish between real and spurious measurements?*

\
★ *On a population-level, how can we improve the robustness of spin measurements through better statistical model-checking procedures?*

And more! Under each heading below, I describe some of my specific research projects in more detail.

#### Measuring the Spins of Heavy Binary Black Holes

To make robust measurements of the properties of binary black holes observed via gravitational waves, it is essential to connect measured parameters, i.e, masses and spins, with waveform phenomenology, or how these parameters imprint onto the observable gravitational-wave signals.

Without a thorough understanding of the observable imprint of BH spins, spurious measurements could come from small fluctuations in detector noise, data quality issues, or waveform systematics rather than astrophysics.

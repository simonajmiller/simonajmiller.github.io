<span style="background-color:#ed6c58">BIG PICTURE: what are GWs, BBHs, LIGO, spin. Include some images. </span>

I am interested in how, when, and why we can measure subtle effects in gravitational-wave signals, from both an astrophysical and statistical standpont. 
I want to answer questions like: How do precessing spins imprint on merger/ringdown-dominated gravitational waves? What non-astrophysical phenomena can mimic spins and how do we distinguish between real and spurious measurements? On a population-level, how can we improve the robustness of spin measurements through better statistical model-checking procedures?

I will explain the following sub sections of my research ... <span style="background-color:#ed6c58">FILL IN HERE</span>

#### Measuring the Spins of Heavy Binary Black Holes

To make robust measurements of the properties of binary black holes observed via gravitational waves, it is essential to connect measured parameters, i.e, masses and spins, with waveform phenomenology, or how these parameters imprint onto the observable gravitational-wave signals.

Without a thorough understanding of the observable imprint of BH spins, spurious measurements could come from small fluctuations in detector noise, data quality issues, or waveform systematics rather than astrophysics.
